These challenges are for <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/blob/master/week-02-ajax-and-js-objects/day-01/module-01/readme.md" target="_blank">today's lesson on debugging</a>.

Fork -> Clone this repo, then open the index.html.

The `index.html` will include a single JavaScript library `main.js`.

Your job is to use the Chrome Developer tools to debug the execution flow in the JavaScript code. When you find a bug, add a comment on the line above the bug showing the current value of the code which has a bug and what the value should be. Then fix the line to the best of your abilities.

The function is somewhat illogical - it is OK to remove non essential functionality. The most important part is to use the JavaScript Debugger to accomplish this challenge quickly.

The solution is found on the `solution` branch.

## Bonus Challenges

* Use the JavaScript Profiler to compare a `for` loop and a `forEach` loop. Which is faster? Find someone to share the results with.
* Use the JavaScript Auditor on <a href="https://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly's Site</a> then research solutions to any perceived deficiency in the site.
